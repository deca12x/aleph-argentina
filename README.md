# 🌍 Aleph: The First On-Chain AR Social Experience

![Aleph Banner](assets/aleph-banner.png)

## Vision

At DevConnect, thousands of builders come together to share ideas—but these moments are fleeting. **What if we could make the invisible visible? What if knowledge, connections, and history could persist in the real world, anchored to physical locations?**

Aleph turns **real-world locations into tradable digital real estate** by putting **AR objects on-chain**. We're creating a **SocialFi experience** where **hidden knowledge, prizes, and digital artifacts** shape a new economy of **on-chain urban storytelling.**

## 🛠 What We Built

Aleph is a **fully functional AR SocialFi tool** that combines augmented reality with blockchain technology:

### Core Features

✅ **Location-Based AR Experiences**

- Scan QR codes at physical locations to discover hidden 3D Easter eggs
- Experience persistent digital content anchored to real-world coordinates
- Interact with AR objects that have real on-chain value

✅ **On-Chain AR Real Estate**

- Each physical location becomes a tokenized digital asset (NFT)
- Limited 3D spaces with provable scarcity and ownership
- Dynamic price floors create competitive markets for popular locations

✅ **Social Bidding Mechanism**

- Leave messages and 3D content at any location
- To replace existing content, users must pay more than the previous creator
- Creates an engaging economic game around content creation

✅ **Decentralized Urban Storytelling**

- Build layered narratives tied to physical places
- Preserve event memories, knowledge, and cultural artifacts on-chain
- Create a permanent, accessible record of community interactions

## 💡 Why It Matters

🌐 **A Living Memory of DevConnect** – Messages, memes, and insights left at DevConnect locations **persist beyond the event**, becoming part of a shared on-chain knowledge base.

🎭 **Social & Gamified** – The thrill of **finding hidden Easter eggs** and competing for visibility **creates viral engagement**.

📍 **Location-Tied Digital Ownership** – Just like domains exist on the web, **we create digital ownership of real-world AR spaces**.

## 🔧 Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React, Next.js, Three.js
- **AR Technology**: Scaniverse + 8th Wall
- **Blockchain**: Deployed on Mantle Network and zkSync Era
- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity custom contract deployed on Mantle Mainnet and ZKSync Era Mainnet.
  The contract stores Ethereal messages on-chain secturely and is optimized for gas efficiency using tight packing with in line assembly.
